# Sip TRiggered Optogenetic Behavior Enclosure (STROBE) Software and Source
This repository contains the UI source and executable, and Python post-processing scripts for the STROBE device.

The STROBE UI was built in Visual Studios 2012 in C++ on Windows 10. It will require installation of Qt 5.11 in order to compile. Included in the source are all 3rd party modules ([FTD2XX](http://www.ftdichip.com), [qtcustomplot](https://www.qcustomplot.com/), etc) needed to compile the executable.
